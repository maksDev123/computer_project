    '''
    Finds and return strongly connected comnonents and returns
    list of integer that represent lowest of vertices for this component
    If data type is inappropriate than None will be returned.

    Input: vertices - number of vertices, graph - dictionary of connectivity
    Output: list of lowest id of every scc

    >>> scc("a", {1: [2], 2: [1]})
    >>> scc(2, [0, 1])

    This was made using tarjan algorithm for scc.
